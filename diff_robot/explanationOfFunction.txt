so teh analysis controller fucntion is designed to feed into the visual sensor model essentially to act as a  traffic controller. 
Analysis Controller's Role:

    It determines when analysis should happen.
    When waypointReached is true and it transitions to Stopped For Analysis mode, it sets its output triggerNNAnalysis to true.

triggerNNAnalysis Signal's Role:

    This boolean signal (true when analysis is needed, false otherwise) is then connected to the Enable port of the "Visual Sensor Model" subsystem.

"Visual Sensor Model" Subsystem's Role:

    This is the subsystem thats already built, which contains:
        the fakeCameraPOV (the MATLAB Function block that creates the image based on the robot's position).
        The image processing blocks (Convert Image to single, Resize).
        the Deep Learning "Predict" block (the one using getTomatoNet).
        The get_label MATLAB Function block.

    Crucially, because it's an Enabled Subsystem:
        When triggerNNAnalysis is true, the "Visual Sensor Model" subsystem becomes active. It will run one simulation step, take the simulated image input, process it, feed it to the CNN, get a prediction, and generate the analysisFinished output signal.
        When triggerNNAnalysis is false, the "Visual Sensor Model" subsystem is inactive. It will not execute, and its outputs will hold their last value or default to zero.

analysisFinished Signal's Role:

    Once the "Visual Sensor Model" has completed its analysis (i.e., its CNN has made a prediction for that image), it needs to output a true pulse on its analysisFinished signal.
    This analysisFinished signal then feeds back as an input to the Analysis Controller MATLAB Function block.

Back to Analysis Controller:

    Upon receiving analysisFinished = true, the Analysis Controller knows the analysis is done for the current waypoint.
    It then deactivates triggerNNAnalysis (disabling the "Visual Sensor Model") and activates goToNextWaypoint, allowing the robot to proceed.
